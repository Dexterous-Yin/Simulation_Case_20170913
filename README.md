This code is used to reproduce the observations for pitch-angle distribution of protons from Van Allen Probe B during the magnetic dip event on 13 September 2017. The basic algorithm of this set of code is to use the Runge-Kutta method (ode45 fuction in MATLAB) to calculate the motion of particle's guiding center (Northrop, 1963).
